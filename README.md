# RL_2048
Reinforcement Learning for 2048

This repository aims at presenting our work for the Reinforcement Learning group project. We chose to do our project on the game 2048. To play the game, we developed two agents, each using a different method. These agents are based on Deep Q-Network and N-Tuple respectively. In this report, we will thus present the environment that we used and its specificities, we will then present the architecture of each of the models and perform a comparative study on there respective performances.

#### Deep Q-Network

The Deep Q-Network implementation is available in `DQN_Implementation.ipynb`.
